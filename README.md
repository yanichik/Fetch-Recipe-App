3. Run application on iPhone

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
Besides meeting the basic assignment requirements, I focused on smooth functionality, clean UI, proper testing, and code readability. By "smooth functionality", I am referring to image loading on scroll and gracefully handling errors because those are essential features to a delightful user experience.
I created simple and clean UI so that the user may easily and quickly understand what is going on in the view.
With regard to testing, I ensured to write tests to all of the primary features (networking and caching) that the business logic relies on.
And finally, I ensured to make my code easy to understand for the next engineer, by using logical names and adding helpful comments.    

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent 6.5 hours on the project. The first order of business was to ensure all of the necessary functionality is working (networking, caching, error handling, testing) and I spent 5 hours on that. I spent the remaining 1.5 hours on cleaning up the code, simplifying, refactoring, adding more comments, and formatting.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
The main trade-off for this app was using a simple UI and focusing on functionality and UX. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The UI can be enhanced with better spacing, larger images, perhaps using a collection view, and appealing colors.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
Very much enjoyed this project, and look forward to discussing in greater detail.
